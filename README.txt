Usage:
Commands can be found on start up of the program. To message someone, you must first 
/connect, then /mess them. After that, anything you type will be sent to the user
you messaged. 

To establish encrypted connection, use /enc_connect to connect instead of /connect.

To message someone else, just use /mess USER on the next person you want
to message (This person must be connected to you). 

You can have up to 10 people maximum connected to you at a time.
